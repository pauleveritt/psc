# Building PSC

This PSC package is a proof-of-concept of a possible future PyScript Collective.
To make it easy to evaluate, it's written diary-style.
At each step:

- Make a branch
- Write docs for the problem being solved
- Notes on the solution
- Open questions
- Merge

This section covers each step in the prototype.
