<p>Examples...it's what the Collective does! The examples in the Gallery come in different flavors. Let's take a
    look.</p>

<section>
    <a id="integrated"></a>
    <h1>Integrated</h1>
    <p>The featured examples have something in common...they all use the same CSS and same PyScript/Pyodide. This makes
        the page-to-page experience really slick. As a side effect, it makes it easier for us to manage, co-own, test, etc.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <a id="secondary"></a>
    <h1>Secondary</h1>
    <p>Some examples need to be more standalone: their own styling, their own Pyodide. These run in an
        <code>iframe</code> and might not have the same QA level.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <a id="incubator"></a>
    <h1>Incubator</h1>
    <p>Sometimes we have newcomers with a crazy new idea for an example. The code isn't polished, might not be tested. And most of all, the Collective team might not want to take long-term ownership.</p>
    <p>These go in the "incubator" part of the Collective.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <a id="gallery"></a>
    <h1>Gallery</h1>
    <p>The Gallery is, surprisingly, a Python package -- `psga`. You can install it and run it! The same content that goes up on the website, goes out in the package.</p>

    <p>PWA offline-first, edit-in-place.</p>
